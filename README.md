# Dependency-Parsing-ArcEager-
Dependency Parsing with Arc-Eager Parser and BERT-based BiLSTM Model

Overview

This project aims to develop a dependency parsing system using the Arc-Eager parsing algorithm combined with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term 
Memory (BiLSTM) model fine-tuned with BERT embeddings. The primary objective is to accurately analyze the syntactic relationships between words 
in a sentence and generate a dependency tree representation.

Background

Dependency parsing is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence 
by determining the syntactic relationships (dependencies) between words. The Arc-Eager parsing algorithm is a widely used transition-based 
approach that incrementally builds a dependency tree by predicting a series of parsing actions.

Methodology

This project involves the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: The input sentences are preprocessed to prepare them for the parsing process. This may involve tokenization, part-of-speech 
(POS) tagging, and other necessary preprocessing steps.
Feature Extraction: Features are extracted from the preprocessed sentences to provide input to the parsing model. In this project, 
BERT embeddings are utilized to capture contextualized representations of the words in the sentence.
Arc-Eager Parser: The Arc-Eager parsing algorithm is implemented, which operates by applying a series of parsing actions to build the dependency 
tree. These actions include shifting a word onto the stack, reducing words based on their dependencies, and creating new dependencies between
words.
BiLSTM Model: A Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model is employed to predict the parsing actions. The model takes the BERT 
embeddings as input and learns to classify the appropriate action at each step of the parsing process.
Fine-tuning with BERT: The BiLSTM model is fine-tuned using BERT embeddings to enhance its performance on the specific dependency parsing task. 
Fine-tuning helps the model capture contextual information and improve its ability to handle various sentence structures.
Training and Evaluation: The model is trained using labeled dependency parsing data, and its performance is evaluated using standard evaluation 
metrics such as unlabeled attachment score (UAS).

Results and Discussion

The performance of the Arc-Eager parser combined with the BERT-based BiLSTM model is assessed based on evaluation metrics such as UAS. 
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in accurately capturing the syntactic relationships between words. 
The system achieves high accuracy in predicting the dependencies, enabling robust syntactic analysis of natural language sentences.

Conclusion

This project presents a comprehensive dependency parsing system that combines the efficient Arc-Eager parsing algorithm with the powerful 
contextualized embeddings from BERT. By leveraging the capabilities of the BiLSTM model fine-tuned with BERT, the system achieves accurate 
dependency tree generation.
